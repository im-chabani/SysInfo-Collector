# SysInfo-Collector
## Why SysInfo-Collector?

### Use Case : **Tracking Company Computers:** Automate and simplifies the way to track down the computers in your own network or in your company.
I developed the "SysInfo-Collector" script for a straightforward and practical reason: to simplify the process of tracking and managing the computers within my personal network. As a tech enthusiast and someone who values efficient organization, I found it essential to have a reliable tool for effortlessly gathering and recording vital information about each computer in my network.  

  
### Script Functionality
The script, whether run as an executable or directly from PowerShell, performs the following tasks:  

   
1. **Gather Computer Information:** It extracts essential computer details, including:
   - Manufacturer (Brand)
   - Model
   - Operating System (OS)
   - Serial Number
   - Computer Name
   - Current User
  
     
2. **Output Data:** The collected information is structured and saved to a text file named "ComputerInfo_<CurrentUser>.txt." This text file can be found in the same directory where the script is run.


### How to execute 
**- Using PowerShell:** You have two options to run the script in PowerShell:  

   First, you can right-click on "SysInfo-Collector.ps1" and select "Run with PowerShell."  
      
   Second, open PowerShell, navigate to the file's location, and type "./SysInfo-Collector.ps1" and press Enter.  

     
**- User-Friendly Option:** If you prefer an easier way, I've also created an executable (.exe) version of the script. You can run it just like any other program, without needing to use PowerShell directly.   

You don't need Administrator privileges for either method. The choice is yours!  

  
Feel free to tailor and use "SysInfo-Collector" to suit your own personal or small-scale organizational needs. It's all about making the task of computer management more convenient and efficient. Enjoy!
