# SysInfo-Collector
## Why SysInfo-Collector?

### Use Case : **Tracking Company Computers:** Automate and simplifies the way to track down the computers in your own network or in your company.
I developed the "SysInfo-Collector" script for a straightforward and practical reason: to simplify the process of tracking and managing the computers within my personal network. As a tech enthusiast and someone who values efficient organization, I found it essential to have a reliable tool for effortlessly gathering and recording vital information about each computer in my network.


### Script Functionality
The script, whether run as an executable or directly from PowerShell, performs the following tasks:

1. **Gather Computer Information:** It extracts essential computer details, including:
   - Manufacturer (Brand)
   - Model
   - Operating System (OS)
   - Serial Number
   - Computer Name
   - Current User

2. **Output Data:** The collected information is structured and saved to a text file named "ComputerInfo_<CurrentUser>.txt." This text file can be found in the same directory where the script is run.


### Executable File
If you prefer a user-friendly experience, I've also provided an executable (.exe) version of the script. You can simply run it without needing to interact directly with PowerShell. The choice is yours and you do **not** need Administrator privilege in either way.


Feel free to tailor and use "SysInfo-Collector" to suit your own personal or small-scale organizational needs. It's all about making the task of computer management more convenient and efficient. Enjoy!
